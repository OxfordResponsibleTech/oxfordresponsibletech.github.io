## Who we are
We are an alumni group for University of Oxford graduates that are passionate about enabling a more responsible technology and innovation landscape. Breaking down silos, we are a diverse community of computer scientists, economists, ethicists, philosophers, lawyers, and sociologists (to name a few!) working across the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors in different countries around the world. Founded in March 2022, we aim to foster a multidisciplinary dialogue on technology topics, as well as develop a network of experts that can work together to irrigate ethical decision-making around the globe. 

You can find us on LinkedIn and Twitter. Follow us to stay up to date on news, events, and programming.

## Lori Roussey - Outreach and Partnerships
Lori Roussey is a lawyer passionate about data protection, cybersecurity, access to information and effective access to justice rights. As an activist she is involved in strategic litigation projects to prevent undemocratically agreed state and corporate surveillance and lock in. She was for instance involved with a 2021 ruling of the highest EU court that required states to inform individuals who have been subject to secret intelligence or police surveillance once they are no longer perceived as a threat, a core safeguard demanded by digital rights activists for decades. In her career Lori advises on humanitarian and national security data rights compliance. She joined the founding of the Responsible Technology Alumni Network to help set up a beacon in the night for fellow students looking to dissociate the digital economy with a society where more comfort comes at the price of our right to intimacy and intellectual freedom.

_Lori graduated from the University of Oxford with an MSc in the Social Science of the Internet in 2022, where her research centered on Internet economics of monopolistic actors, dual use technology regulation and the impacts of surveillance on human behavior. Her master thesis focussed on the outsourcing of data processing tasks to private actors by administrations in Public Private Partnerships and the loss of accountability and human rights erosion it led to._
