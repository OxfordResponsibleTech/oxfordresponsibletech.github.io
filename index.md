# What we stand for

Technology is a subject of interdisciplinary importance; its ubiquity across sectors and vast permeation of society has made its appropriate use and regulation one of the biggest challenges of the modern era. Recent developments, such as the increasing use of AI, the transformation of economies towards data-centric decision-making models, and evolving challenges for privacy and ethics are just some of the numerous issues we now face. 

## _If we do not understand the problem, how can we hope to develop solutions?_

The need to pay closer attention to the social, ethical, legal, and environmental impacts of technology has already manifested itself at Oxford: the activities of the Oxford Internet Institute and the Institute for Ethics in AI are just some of the most prominent initiatives. Our group is necessary to ensure the continuity of these existing efforts at Oxford amongst our rich alumni network to provoke reflection, experience sharing and action in the responsible technology space. 

## _To enable responsible technology, we need to break down silos._

This alumni group is not solely for computer scientists, technologists, lawyers, or ethicists - it is for everyone and anyone engaged in work that is focused on enabling a technology sector that is aligned with the needs of society and the planet. We believe strongly in breaking down disciplinary silos in these efforts, as diverse perspectives are required to develop thoughtful, holistic, and relevant contributions to this space, whether through research, product development, advisory services, or regulations.

## We look forward to welcoming you as a member!
