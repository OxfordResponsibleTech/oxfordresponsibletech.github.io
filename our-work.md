# Our Work

## What we do
We are an alumni group for University of Oxford graduates that are passionate about enabling a more responsible technology and innovation landscape. Breaking down silos, we are a diverse community of computer scientists, economists, ethicists, philosophers, lawyers, and sociologists (to name a few!) working across the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors in different countries around the world. Founded in March 2022, we aim to foster a multidisciplinary dialogue on technology topics, as well as develop a network of experts that can work together to irrigate ethical decision-making around the globe. 

You can find us on LinkedIn and Twitter. Follow us to stay up to date on news, events, and programming.
