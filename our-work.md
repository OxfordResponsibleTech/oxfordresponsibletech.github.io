# Our Work

## What we do
We provide a space for alumni to stay connected to Oxford and their university colleagues, whilst opening up opportunities to forge new connections and keep up to date on key developments in the field of responsible technology. 

Our key activities include organizing: 
- Speaker series, forums, and roundtables on technology related topics
- Themed networking events
- Signposting to crowdsourced resources on responsible technology
- Mentorship programmes

We are also committed to providing opportunities for members to contribute to the field of responsible technology, such as participating in campaigns to raise awareness on social and/or environmental issues related to technology and running fundraisers to support responsible technology-related research at Oxford through bursaries, volunteer opportunities, and work placements.

## Suggestions welcome.
